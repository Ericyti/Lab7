1. When fitting my automated tests in my Recipie Project development pipeline I would chooose to run my tests within a github action that runs whenever code is being pushed and this is because when I push my code it would auotmatically check if the browser would run and output something because when I was working on my code, I sometimes pushed a test which would result in the page being blank which is bad in a real life scenario. It is also good using automated tests as the test could potentially catch a bug before the code is even reviewed which can allow for the developer to make the necessary changes before the code is reviewed by another person.
